# Discrete-multi-wavelength-photometer
Development of a mobile discrete multi-wavelength photometer (LED-Array, TSL2651, Arduino Nano, SD-Card, 3D-Printing)

- An LED array together with a TSL2561 (Arduino version) is used for measurement
- The system is controlled and calculations are performed using an Arduino Nano
- 3D printed housing and larger components
